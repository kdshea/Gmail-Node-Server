# Node Server for Form Submission

This repository contains the Node server code used to handle form submissions from my personal portfolio page [kdshea.com](https://kdshea.com/). The server receives data from my consultation form and sends it to me as an email. This setup allows me to collect and process user input from my portfolio website.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The server is built using Express, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
2. CORS middleware is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing requests from different domains.
3. The server utilizes the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
4. Nodemailer is used to send email notifications using the Gmail service.
5. When a form submission is received at the `/submit-form` endpoint, the server extracts the form data and sends it as an email to the specified recipient.
6. Success or failure messages are sent back as a response to the client.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before running the server, make sure to set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file:

- `GMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail account username or email address.
- `PASSWORD`: The app password generated for your Gmail account.

**Note:** To generate an app password, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Gmail account settings.
2. Navigate to the "Security" section.
3. Find the "App Passwords" option.
4. Generate a new app password for your Node server.
5. Copy the generated password and use it as the `PASSWORD` environment variable.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Set up the environment variables in a `.env` file.
3. Run the server using `node server.js`.
4. The server will start running on the specified port (referenced in `consts.js`).

## üì¨ API Endpoint

The server exposes a single endpoint:

- `POST /submit-form`: Receives form data and sends it as an email to the specified recipient. The following fields are expected in the request body: `name`, `company`, `email`, `currentWebsite`, `helpWith`, `projectDetails`, `howDidYouHear`.
